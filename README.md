## What I want to build

web app that creates resumes and cover letters for tech people

## More Detailed Description

had you ever looked at a vacancy and thought "damn they need ME" but didn't know how to express it in a resume? i sure as hell had.
the app consumes information about a user (say general purpose resume) and a vacancy, and produces a well crafted resume tailored for the vacancy, with a cover letter that supplements the resume. it utilizes AI for processing and generation.

## Background (What made you decide to build this particular app? What inspired you?)

i always struggled with creating a resume, coming up with what to include and determining achievments. a tool that lifts that burden from me would be superb. there are already similar apps in existence but they do not implement this idea fully. i.e. some lack ability to supply the vacancy to tailor the resume specifically for it, others don't have the ux i'd want, some are overly complex and require too much work.

## How will you utilize RedwoodJS?
